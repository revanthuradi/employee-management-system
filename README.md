Introduction
The Employee Management System is a full-stack web application developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It allows users to manage employee data efficiently with features like authentication (signup and login), CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for employee information, and real-time notifications.

This application is ideal for small and medium-sized organizations looking to maintain a database of employees with a simple and intuitive UI and secure backend.

Features
User authentication with JWT (JSON Web Token) stored in local storage.
Passwords are securely hashed using bcryptjs.
Full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for employee data.
Responsive design using Tailwind CSS.
Form validation using Formik and Yup.
Toast notifications for user feedback.
Role-based access (admin functionalities for employee management).
